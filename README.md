# car_class_and_car_price_prediction_with_machine_learning
Built Machine learning model which can predict price and class of a car.
# Problem statement:
The automobile industry is constantly growing and evolving, with the emergence of new technologies and features that make cars more advanced and sophisticated. The increasing number of car models and brands in the market has made it challenging for customers to determine the value of a car or classify it into a specific category. Therefore, car price prediction and car class classification have become crucial tasks in the automotive industry.
#Objective:
The objective of this project was to determine the optimal machine learning algorithm for car price prediction and car class classification. We evaluated the performance of each algorithm using different metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, accuracy, and F1-score. Our findings will provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of different machine learning algorithms for car price prediction and car class classification.
#Data
1)Car price dataset contains information about cars such as make, model, year, engine type, horsepower, and others. 2) Car class dataset contains information about car such as Compactness, Circularity, Circularityscaled variance along major axis ,scaled variance along minor axis,scaled radius of gyration,skewness about major axis, skewness about minor axis etc.
The dataset is split into a training set and a test set. The training set is used to train the different algorithms, while the test set is used to evaluate the performance of the algorithms.
#Algorithms
The project uses the following machine learning algorithms to predict the price and classify the cars:
Linear Regression
Lasso Regression
Ridge Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
Support Vector Machines
#Evaluation:
The performance of each algorithm is evaluated using the mean squared error (MSE),F1-Score, the accuracy score and plotting the confusion matrix. The MSE measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual prices, while the accuracy score measures the percentage of correctly classified cars.
